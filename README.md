Matcharoni<sub>('n cheese)</sub> is a mixed paradigm language based around
pattern matching, and has been developed around parsing and solving
[Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/) problems.

To get a taste of the language, let's parse some Advent of Code puzzle inputs in
this README.

### You can also see the full solutions in the [web editor](TODO) or the Advent of Code speedrun video:

### [Day 1: Sonar Sweep](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1)

Our `input.txt` contains:

```
199
200
208
210
200
207
240
269
260
263
```

A list of integers separated by newlines, classic. Let's start with a single
`digit`.

```elm
pat digit { '0' => 0, '1' => 1, '2' => 2, '3' => 3, '4' => 4, '5' => 5, '6' => 6, '7' => 7, '8' => 8, '9' => 9 }
```

The `number` pattern below matches one or more digits, and binds that to the
`digits` variable. That is, `@` is for binding **pattern matches** into
variables that can be used in the **pattern expression**.

```elm
// `digit` is a reference to the pattern we defined earlier, and bound to the
// `digits` variable using the `digits@` syntax.
pat number (digits@[digit]{1+}) => {
  // `digits` is used in the list comprehension below
  sum [(*digits * (10 ** (#digits - (%digits + 1)))) <- digits]
}
```

The list comprehension has a bunch of special symbols in it.

- `[*xs <- xs]` is a list comprehension. `xs` is the list being mapped over, and
  `*xs` is the individual list on that iteration

  **Mnemonic: `*`, kinda like deref in C**
- `%xs` is the index of the current element in the map expression. For example,
  `[%xs <- ['a', 'a', 'a']]` produces `[0, 1, 2]`

  **Mnemonic: `%`, as in the _percentage_ we've progressed through the list**
- `#xs` is the length of `xs`.

  **Mnemonic: `#`, as in _number of elements_**

And now we can match the whole input,

```elm
pat parse_input ([numbers<@number ~ '\n']{1+}) => numbers
```

- `numbers<@PAT` means take all matches of the `number` pattern found while
  matching the expression and shovel them into the `numbers` list
- `~` is the **concat** operator

Let's also define `sum` which we used in the `number` pattern but never defined.

```elm
pat sum ns@[Int] => {
  acc = 0
  for ns { acc = acc + *ns }
  acc
}
```

And boom!

```elm
dbg(parse_input(read_to_string("./input.txt")))
```

`[199, 200, 208, 210, 200, 207, 240, 269, 260, 263]`

### [Day 4: Giant Squid](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/4)

Our `input.txt` contains some comma separated numbers followed by 2 newlines,
followed by some bingo cards, separated by two newlines each.

```
7,4,9,5,11,17,23,2,0,14,21,24,10,16,13,6,15,25,12,22,18,20,8,19,3,26,1

22 13 17 11  0
 8  2 23  4 24
21  9 14 16  7
 6 10  3 18  5
 1 12 20 15 19

 3 15  0  2 22
 9 18 13 17  5
19  8  7 25 23
20 11 10 24  4
14 21 16 12  6

14 21 17 24  4
10 16 15  9 19
18  8 23 26 20
22 11 13  6  5
 2  0 12  3  7
```

Let's start with the comma separated numbers at the top, reusing the `number`
pattern from the previous example:

```elm
pat csnums ([nums<@number ~ ','] ~ nums<@number) => nums
```

The twist here is that we shovel into nums (`nums<@`) twice, once to bind number
preceded by commas, and one for the last number which isn't followed by a comma.

```elm
// returns a list of numbers (one row)
pat bingo_row [[' '] ~ nums<@number]{5} => nums
// returns a list of list of numbers (the whole card)
pat bingo_card [rows<@bingo_row ~ '\n']{5} => rows
```

- `[' ']` means to match any number of spaces
- `{5}` means that the preceding list needs to contain exactly 5 elements

Putting it all together, chained together with `~` (concat) operators, we have a
high level description of our input:

```elm
pat parse_input (called@csnums ~ ['\n'] ~
                 [cards<@bingo_card ~ ['\n']]) => {
  (called, cards)
}

// and it returns a tuple that we can destructure
(called, cards) = parse_input(read_to_string("./input.txt"))
dbg("called", called)
dbg("cards", cards)
```

Outputs

```
("called", [7, 4, 9, 5, 11, 17, 23, 2, 0, 14, 21, 24, 10, 16, 13, 6, 15, 25, 12, 22, 18, 20, 8, 19, 3, 26, 1])
("cards", [[[22, 13, 17, 11, 0], [8, 2, 23, 4, 24], [21, 9, 14, 16, 7], [6, 10, 3, 18, 5], [1, 12, 20, 15, 19]], [[3, 15, 0, 2, 22], [9, 18, 13, 17, 5], [19, 8, 7, 25, 23], [20, 11, 10, 24, 4], [14, 21, 16, 12, 6]], [[14, 21, 17, 24, 4], [10, 16, 15, 9, 19], [18, 8, 23, 26, 20], [22, 11, 13, 6, 5], [2, 0, 12, 3, 7]]])
```

## Build and run instructions

Matcharoni<sub>('n cheese)</sub> depends on
[Rust nightly](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). If you're a Rust
programmer, you know what to do. Just make sure you have the nightly version of
the compile enabled, since this won't compile on Rust stable.

```bash
$ cargo build --release && ./target/release/matcharoni
# or
$ cargo install --path . && matcharoni
```

## Status

This is a proof of concept for [langjam #2](https://github.com/langjam/jam0002)
where we had a week to make a language around the theme `"patterns"`. Future
plans for this language include a code formatter, type checker with inference,
and a way to debug patterns that don't match.

In the shorter term, I'd like to add anonymous patterns (√† la anonymous
functions), and being able to bind patterns to variables in any block scope
using the `@=` operator.

And to basically evolve the language of the design using this year's Advent of
Code problems.
